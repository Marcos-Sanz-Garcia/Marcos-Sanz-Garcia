I've recently graduated from my Big Data & Business Analytics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid where I developed my statistical, data science, machine learning and data engineering techniques needed to obtain actionable business insights and solve business problems with data. <br>

My work as a Data Analyst in the manufacturing industry focuses in the supply chain area and has allowed me to explore how DS and ML methodologies can be leveraged to add significant business value by analyzing, mining and exploiting available information. I'm currently working on improving models to predict stock returns and to improve logistic productivity. I'm constantly serching for new applications of ML models in this field and how to approach difficult problems and uncover patterns in data<br>

I'm passionate about coding, data science and machine learning. You can learn more about me and explore my work on my personal website. I'm always learning, always sharing and always challenging myself!
